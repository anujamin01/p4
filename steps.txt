/*
1. Pull inode bitmap
2. Find first available spot in inode table by iterating through bitmap
3. Mark that bit as a 1, indicating we are now putting an inode in that spot
4. Create an inode struct, fill it with relevant info
5. Pull datablock bitmap
6. Find first available data block by iteration
7. Mark that spot in the bitmap as being filled
8. Put the address of that data block in your new inode's direct pointer list
9. memcpy() (or something else idk) your inode into the inode table
at the index you found in step 2
